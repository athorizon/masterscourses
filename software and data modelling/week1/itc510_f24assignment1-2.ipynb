    "For all problems, when asked to write a function you must include code **within the function** to check for valid input parameter values as well as code that calls the function for multipe test cases with valid **and** invalid actual parameter values.  Do **not** use exception handling (**try/except**) statements.\n",

    "This assignment can be done individually or as a group of up to **three students**. Only one student should turn in the assignment but all students in a group should at least submit a comment indicating who was in their group and specifying who is responsible for turning in the assignment. All members of a group should be able to explain any code that has been turned in by the group."

The first parameter must be a list containing only string elements, the second parameter must be a single string and the third parameter should be optional (with a default value of 0) and a non-negative integer.   After validating its input, the function should then replace each string in the list with a new string that overwrites the original string with the string provided as the second input parameter starting at the index provided by the third input parameter.   If the index provided is beyond the index of the last character in the string, then the new string should be concatenated onto the end of the string.   Note: new strings can be longer than the original strings but cannot be shorter.   Additionally, this function MUST NOT return anything but after a successful function call, the array passed to the function should be modified.\n",

If the item is already in the dictionary, then the function should instead increment the value for that item.
